  ## SIDE Projects 

 [Flask bin/hex app](https://github.com/Al3x-s/flaskpractice)
 Created durring the remote training instruction because there was a lack of resources to help us practice bitwise operation and many other networking practices.
 
 [Flask URL Shortener app](https://github.com/Al3x-s/url-shortener)
 Also created during the remote training instruction because I heard the last Cohort created one too
 
 [Flask Study buddy app](https://github.com/Al3x-s/Study-Buddy)
 GPT wrapper - created to help me study and find resources and materials a lot faster with the use of CHATGPT's api 
 took it down because the api is expensive and training the model was getting a little expensive.
 
 [Random Side Projects](https://github.com/Al3x-s/MessAround)
 There are many more things on my personal github but i thought these were the cooler ones so but this is a repo of things ive build OTJ when i have free time around the office currently working on visualizing fractals but in 3D.
